# Healthy-Brain-Network-prediction

In this project i had developed a predictive model that analyzes children's physical activity and fitness data to identify early signs of problematic internet use. Identifying these patterns can help trigger interventions to encourage healthier digital habits.

The datasets are taken from kaggle and the link to the datasets are given in the notebook.

The model is trained only on given dataset using Random Forest Classifier with estimators = 30
