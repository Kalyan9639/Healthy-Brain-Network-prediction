* In this project, I had developed a predictive model that analyzes children's physical activity and fitness data to identify early signs of problematic internet use. Identifying these patterns can help trigger interventions to encourage healthier digital habits.In todayâ€™s digital age, problematic internet use among children and adolescents is a growing concern. Better understanding this issue is crucial for addressing mental health problems such as depression and anxiety.
 
* The dataset is taken from kaggle and the link to the dataset is given in the notebook.

* The model is trained only on given dataset using Random Forest Classifier with estimators = 30
